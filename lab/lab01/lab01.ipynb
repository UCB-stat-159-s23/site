These are tools we are going to use during the semester, so it is a good idea to start using them from the beginning. \n",

    "- The Kernel: what is it? What are good practices when working in a notebook?\n",

    "Notebooks are very flexible and allow you to include a lot of scientific and computing elements together: code, text, figures, equations, media. \n",

    "Another important tool to learn how to use is [iPython](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/site/lectures/intro-jupyter/02-Beyond-Plain-Python.html), which expands the traditional Python capabilities to make it more interactive. In a sense, we can think in iPython as a meta-language on top of Python that allow us to interact with Python code in a more complete way. An example of this are magic functions, that are indicated with the `%` operator. You can take a look to all the magic commands by entering `%quickref` in a cell. "

The **command shell** is a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) software that allows us to interact with our machine.
