For data, you often don’t know what exactly to expect in the output. For example, when you subset a dataset, how do you know the result is correct?\n",

As they explore the data, they may draw plots or create summary tables, in which they may be able to discover problems (e.g., wrong categories, outliers, and so on). Notebooks are great for these inline output elements, from which you can make quick discoveries.\n",
