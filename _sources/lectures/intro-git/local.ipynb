    "The fundamental unit of information in git is what is called a _commit_. A commit is a snapshot of a work at a point in time. Now, for version control systems we don't want to have just one snapshot of our work, but instead we want many of them. Furthermore, instead of a linear sequence of snapshots we may imagine having multiple lines or branches of snapshots including different versions of our project. These commits are then organized in a directed acyclic graph, as the one shown in the following picture.\n",
