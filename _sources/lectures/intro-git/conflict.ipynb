    "While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the same file in the same location, it simply can't decide which change should prevail.  At that point, human intervention is necessary to make the decision.  Git will help you by marking the location in the file that has a problem, but it's up to you to resolve the conflict.  Let's see how that works by intentionally creating a conflict.\n",

    "While it's a good idea to understand the basics of fixing merge conflicts by hand, in some cases you may find the use of an automated tool useful.  Git supports multiple [merge tools](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mergetool.html): a merge tool is a piece of software that conforms to a basic interface and knows how to merge two files into a new one.  Since these are typically graphical tools, there are various to choose from for the different operating systems, and as long as they obey a basic command structure, git can work with any of them.\n",
