    "In particular I've reused the excellent images from the [Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book) that John had already selected and downloaded, as well as some of his outline.  But this version of the tutorial aims to be 100% reproducible by being executed directly as an IPython notebook and is hosted itself on GitHub so that others can more easily make improvements to it by collaborating on Github.  Many thanks to John and Emanuele for making their materials available online.\n",

Johansson](https://github.com/jrjohansson)'s [tutorial on version control](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/master/Lecture-7-Revision-Control-Software.ipynb) that is also written as a fully reproducible notebook and is also aimed at a scientific audience.  It has a similar spirit to this one, and is part of his excellent series [Lectures on Scientific Computing with Python](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) that is entirely available as Jupyter Notebooks."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured in the following way: we will begin with a brief overview of key concepts you need to understand in order for git to really make sense.  We will then dive into hands-on work: after a brief interlude into necessary configuration we will discuss 5 \"stages of git\" with scenarios of increasing sophistication and complexity, introducing the necessary commands for each stage:\n",
    "            \n",
    "1. Local, single-user, linear workflow\n",
    "2. Single local user, branching\n",
    "3. Using remotes as a single user\n",
    "4. Remotes for collaborating in a small team\n",
    "5. Full-contact github: distributed collaboration with large teams\n",
    "    \n",
    "In reality, this tutorial only covers stages 1-4, since for #5 there are many software development-oriented tutorials and documents of very high quality online.  But most scientists start working alone with a few files or with a small team, so I feel it's important to build first the key concepts and practices based on problems scientists encounter in their everyday life and without the jargon of the software world.  Once you've become familiar with 1-4, the excellent tutorials that exist about collaborating on GitHub on open-source projects should make sense."
