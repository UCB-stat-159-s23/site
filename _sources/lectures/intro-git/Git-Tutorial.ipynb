    "The problem is that Bob's changes create a commit that conflicts with Alice's, so git refuses to apply them.  It forces Bob to first do the merge on his machine, so that if there is a conflict in the merge, Bob deals with the conflict manually (git could try to do the merge on the server, but in that case if there's a conflict, the server repo would be left in a conflicted state without a human to fix things up).  The solution is for Bob to first pull the changes (pull in git is really fetch+merge), and then push again."
