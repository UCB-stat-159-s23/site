    "In our previous lecture about modularization, we already discussed the concept of modules and how to import them. A package is a collection of modules that we can now import together and document separately. \n",
    "For this lecture, we are going to follow the following minimal Python package, [mytoy](https://github.com/fperez/mytoy). You can clone this repository in you local machine:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/fperez/mytoy.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "This repository contains a minimal, toy Python package with a few files as illustration for students of how to lay out their code to meet minimal Python packaging requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a single source directory (`mytoy`) with an `__init__.py` file and one \"implementation\" file (`toys.py`) as well as a few tests in `mytoy/tests`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this `README.md` it includes some basic infrastructure: `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py` and `.gitignore` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only docs included are this `README.md` file - a larger package would have a proper docs directory and associated Sphinx/JupyterBook build.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more or less the absolute minimum for a \"real\" python package that can be installed from source, tested and experimented with on Binder.  For a more \"official\" version of this same idea, see the [PyPA sample project repo](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject), documented in detail in the [Packaging Tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects). The [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org) contains comprehensive documentation on this topic.\n",
