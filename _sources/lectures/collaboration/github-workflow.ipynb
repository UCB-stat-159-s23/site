    "> \"Release early, release often\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this? Because this will provide feedback from the community that will furthermore help moving the software forward. This is very different than the secretive way many times traditional science tends to work. Not doing this encourages bad practices. \n",

    "Another popular quote knows as the Linus's Law is \n",
    "> \"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to the other quote: with more people looking at more code, the changes of making big mistakes are smaller and the software becomes more robust. This doesn't mean that our code will not have issues, but we are more likely to detect flaws in the design and implementation of the code when more people are looking at it. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two capture a key principle: share your work openly from as early as possible, and thus get more people to look at your work, and the result will be better.  Trick is - how do we put this in practice? The trick is to use \n",

    "\n",
    "Just like the original word atomic that means _indivisible_, this means that we should make commits that express one single idea or implementation. This doesn't necessarily means that we need to commit small changes, but instead each commit implements a new change. Also, we want this commit to have a short message. After the first line of the commit message, we can add a longer description. A general recommendation is to keep the first line of the commit message less than 50 characters. After that, we can enter an space and write more text to expand on the commit message, but the first line serves as a summary and is the one we will refer to most of the times. See [What's with the 50/70 rule?](https://preslav.me/2015/02/21/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule/) for more information about how to write good commit messages. "

Having multiple branches allow us to explore the evolution of the progress much better and in a non-linear fashion. Remember that branches can always being merged, so eventually we can combine different stories of project into the same commit. "

    "\n",
    "When ready for feedback, make a Pull Request (PR) for this work. When you are already to share your code with others, you don't just update the main repository or code. Furthermore, you don't just update one single commit at the time. Instead, we create what is know as a pull request. A pull request means that one user is _requesting_ to some other users to _review_ some changes and eventually approve those changes. An advantage of doing this is that GitHub allow us to maintain an communication between the parts in which feedback and comment can be done. Further changes can be implemented until the pull requests go approved. Also, think in cases where the new changes need to be tested before being incorporated. The moment for running and checking the tests is the PR, where we can also make the changes until all potential checks pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned before, a pull request opens a conversation between the part that is bringing the new implementation and the current maintainers of the software. Either for small and large groups, these parts could be composed by the same or different people. This is why your PR should summarize the overall purpose of the work.\n",

An issues is also atomic: it's a message that address one single problem, question, concern or sometimes even new features that we want to implement.

Eventually, these questions can trigger the creation of issues or even new code, but having a more informal mean of communication also helps to improve the quality of the software and also help newcomers to start interacting with a larger community of users. GitHub supports this forums thought [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart).
