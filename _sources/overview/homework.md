# Homeworks

Homeworks will be announced in Ed Discussion and submitted using GitHub Classroom. The Ed announcement will include a link that you will use to create a 
repository in the [course GitHub site](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-s23). In order to submit your homework, you will need to push your last changes to 
this GitHub repository. 

* #1, due Friday Feb 10, 2023: _Reproducibility checkup on an existing paper_.

* #2, soon to be announced. _From Notebooks to Research Packages_.

* #3, soon to be announced. _Reproducibility in Climate Studies_`*`.


The `*` indicates that the homework assignment is meant to be in a group that will be assigned during the semester. Since one of the goals of the course is to teach you how to work collaboratively, no individual group projects are accepted. For group homework projects, you will include a statement in your repository acknowledging the contribution of each team member. Unless there is a major, unfair imbalance in the amount of work done by each team member, the same grade will be assigned to all team members.

We will accept late homework assignments until 24hrs after the deadline of the homework. However, in those cases a 25% penalty will be applied to the final score. In case of emergency, please reach out to the instructors using Ed Discussion.
