    "\n",
    "We begin with a simple synchronization example, much like we just did in the previous lab, but now between **two people** instead of one person.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice creates a new repository in GitHub with some basic text files on it. For now, let's make this repository hosted in Alice's personal GitHub account and let's make the repository public. \n",

    "1. Bob makes changes to a file and commits them locally.\n",
    "1. Bob pushes his changes to GitHub. Now, in order to Bob to be able to push changes, he needs to be added by Alice as a collaborator of her respository. Alice needs to add Bob as collaborator in her Github setting page. One more detail: Alice needs to be sure that the repo has permission to use the GitHub app we are using for the course! in order to do that, Alice needs first to authenticate and then go the config page in the app and be sure the new repository is listed.\n",
    "1. Alice pulls Bob's changes into her own repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will have both making non-conflicting changes each, and commit them locally.  Then both try to push their changes:\n",

    "1. Add a tag to this stage of the repository. You can learn more about [tag](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html) here. In which cases do you think it will be useful to use tags?\n",
    "1. Bob adds `bob.txt` and commits.\n",
    "1. Alice pushes to GitHub.\n",
    "1. Bob tries to push to GitHub.  What happens here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that Bob's changes create a commit that conflicts with Alice's, so GitHub refuses to apply the changes in the remote. This forces Bob to first merge in his machine. If there is a conflict in the merge, Bob needs to deal with the conflict manually (git could try to do the merge on the server, but in that case if there's a conflict, the server repository would be left in a conflicted state without a human to fix things up).  The solution is for Bob to first pull the changes.\n",

    "1. Bob commits new changes to his branch and then try to push this changes to the remote repository in GitHub. \n",
    "1. Alice now pull the new branch from GitHub. Can Alice display Bob's new branch with `git branch`? What happen when we see `git branch --all`?."

This can lead to some confusion, since this is the same command we use for changing branches. In a sense, `git checkout` does both the work of `git switch` and `git restore`. You can do all the following exercises with `git restore` instead of `git checkout`.  "

This is particularly when working with packages, big projects or just when we want to experiment a little bit having the version control capabilities without adding changes to the main repository.
