    "\n",
    "1. Alice creates a new repository in GitHub with some basic text files on it.\n",
    "1. Bob clones Alice's repository.\n",

    "1. Alice pushes to GitHub.\n",
    "1. Bob tries to push to GitHub.  What happens here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that Bob's changes create a commit that conflicts with Alice's, so GitHub refuses to apply the changes in the remote. This forces Bob to first merge in his machine. If there is a conflict in the merge, Bob needs to deal with the conflict manually (git could try to do the merge on the server, but in that case if there's a conflict, the server repository would be left in a conflicted state without a human to fix things up).  The solution is for Bob to first pull the changes.\n",

This can lead to some confusion, since this is the same command we use for changing branches. In a sense, `git checkout` does both the work of `git switch` and `git restore`. You can do all the following exercises with `git restore` instead of `git checkout`.  "

This is particularly when working with packages, big projects or just when we want to experiment a little bit having the version control capabilities without adding changes to the main repository.
