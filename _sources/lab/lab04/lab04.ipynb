    "1. The first thing you will do is to create two separate functions for the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithms. These are the first things you will see inside the notebook. Think what are the arguments for such functions. \n",
    "2. Now, these two functions do the same but they have different implementations. Most likely, they also have the same arguments and outputs. Create a new function `get_primes` that you call to run both methods. \n",
    "3. Move these three functions to a separate script called `sieve.py`. Remember to import the necessary libraries inside `sieve.py`.\n",
    "4. Import all this function into the notebook using the `import` statement in the first cell of the notebook. \n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "For now, every time you make a change in `sieve.py` and a consequent `import` inside the notebook, you will have to restart the kernel first. This is because once imported, the iPython kernel reads that the script has been already loaded and it doesn't look for differences in the new file. In general, it's a good practice to restart your kernel once the counter starts increasing and after doing significant reorganization changes in the notebook, like we are doing here.\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. In the section _Long Run: proportion of prime numbers_ there is a long run of exactly the same code than before but inside a for loop, so we can evaluate the proportion of prime numbers as we increase the search window. Make a new function called `proportion_primes` that does this.\n",
    "6. You function look good, but now let's add some documentation to them. Add a `docstring` to them. How can you access the docstrings from the notebook? \n",
    "7. Be sure you can run these functions from the notebook _after you move the code to the scripts (no remains in the notebook)_ and _after you have restarted your kernel_."

    "3. Each one of the files inside `sievetools` is called a module. Now, continue your cleaning of `Eratosthenes.ipynb` by moving all the plotting code required to a new module called `plots`. Update `__init__.py` to make the imports of this new module. By the end of the day, you should be able to generate the plots from the notebook using something like\n",

    "### 3.1. Create environment for a project\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways how you can create a new conda environment. For reproducibility, the best practice is to share an `environment.yml` file that includes all the required packages and then create the environment from it. In order to start with this, we are going to start by creating a fresh environment that then we are going to export and share.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First that all, create a new folder in your home directory called `envs`. You can do this from the terminal\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir envs\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Now, go to the `.condarc` file (hidden) in your home directory and be sure that it includes a list of `envs_dirs` with the locations where you are going to install the conda environments. The `.condarc` file should include something like this\n",
    "```\n",
    "envs_dirs:\n",
    "  - ~/envs\n",
    "  - ~/shared/envs \n",
    "```\n",
    "3. In the terminal, let's create a new environment called `test_env` with an specific Python version. It may take a few seconds until it creates the new environment. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n myenv python=3.9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the terminal, do `conda env list` to see the list of all the environments you have installed. Activate the new environment with `conda activate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. At this point, you can run code from this environment just from the terminal. Our next step is to make this environment available from the notebook. Take a look to the [Using an environment in your notebooks](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/site/lectures/environments/environments.html). In order for this to work, first you need to install the `ipykernel` package. You can do this with the following command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba install ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After doing this, you need to let Jupyter know that you want to use this environment’s kernel, by installing the environment’s ipykernel into Jupyter:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name <ENVIRONMENT NAME> --display-name \"IPython - <NAME>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this, the environment should be visible from the notebook. Go to the upper right corner of your notebook and change the kernel. It may be necessary to restart your server in order to make this changes visible. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "What just happened? You have created a new virtual environment in your machine. Where is it? Go inside the `envs` folder and see what is there. This is where you conda environments live. If you delete this folders, the environment disappear.  \n",

So far, nothing really has being installed in your environment. You will need to install basic packages like `numpy` and `matplotlib`. You can use `pip`, `conda` or `mamba` to install packages, but we recommend you to use `mamba` when possible.\n",
    "2. Once you environment has all the required dependencies, export them to a `environment.yml` file. The `conda env export` shows you the contents that should go to the configuration file. We recommend you to use the following syntax at the moment of exporting an environment. \n",
